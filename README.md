Data Camp Module 5 homework

There are two files being submitted. The pymaceuticals_solution.ipynb is the version where I followed the dirrections and the cells generate the requested results.

The pymaceuticals_with_input_options.ipynb was me having a little fun with python. I created an input function where instead of running all the analysis on the drug Capomulin, the user of the notebook must pick a drug from the list of the four we had already filtered the data down to (I considered including all the drugs and could easily ammend the code to include the others), and all the analysis that follows is based on that drug. I made it so it doesn't matter if you give your selection in lower or uppercase, and if someting outside the selection is entered, you will be asked to reenter your selection. For the cell where we have to generate a graph based on the outcomes of one mouse, I coded a randomizer so a each time the cell is run, a different mouse will be selected. I used f-strings to create titles for the charts to specify what drugs info they were generated using.
